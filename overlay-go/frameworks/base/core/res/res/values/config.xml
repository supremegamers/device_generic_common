     <!-- Launcher - configure high/low-res scales for task snapshots
          We recommend setting config_highResTaskSnapshotScale to 0.8, and config_lowResTaskSnapshotScale to
          0.3, but you may want to adjust the scales further depending on your deviceâ€™s screen density.
          Low-res snapshots are only shown for a fraction of a second, so 0.3 should be suitable for most Android
          Go devices even though it appears very blurry. -->

     <!-- Launcher - configure 16-bit task snapshots
          To further save memory, you should also set config_use16BitTaskSnapshotPixelFormat to true. This will
          use RGB_565 hardware bitmaps instead of RGBA_8888 for the rendered task snapshots, which means they
          will only consume half as much memory. -->
